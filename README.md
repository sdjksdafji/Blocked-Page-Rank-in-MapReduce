Blocked-Page-Rank-in-MapReduce
==============================

The project provides 3 method to calculate page rank of a node: simple method, blocked page rank by Gauss-Seidel, or blocked page rank by Jacobi.

3 arguments are needed for running this program.
[use Simple Method or Blocked Gauss-Seidel or Blocked Jacobi: <simple, gauss, jacob>]
[input file or directory: you need to use s3n protocol]
[home directory of the job in s3n protocol]
